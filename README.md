# balanced-brackets
In this problem we have a sting of balanced brackets and we need to get the value .
in this problem we have a sequence of brackets and you have to get the value of the sequence. there are some rules , 
1> if a sequence comes like "()" then the value will be 1. 
2> if a sequence comes like "()()" then we will add both the value ,the value will be 2. 
3> if a sequence is like "(())" then we have to get the value of the sequence which in in side and multiply in by 2, so the value here is 2*1=2.

here is a recursive solution of this problem(in c++)
